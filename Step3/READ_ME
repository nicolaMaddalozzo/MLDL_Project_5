# READ ME Step 3

There are 2 folder: TRPO e DROPO. 

1) Open a terminal inside the DROPO folder and run dropo.py . You can choose the the agent (TRPO or PPO) to be used for generating the dataset D.
After, you can specify a specific model with a directory. Otherwise a default model is used. 
You can specify on which environment generate the data. But, from the DROPO point of view, only the target has sense in this case.
Also the number of steps could be choose,

2) When the algorithm converge, take the output (mu star and sigma star) and write it (by hand) inside the custom_hopper.py inside the TRPO folder -> env folder, line 63,64.65.
   Here, put the mean and standard deviations. 

ATTENTION: DROPO finds 4 mean and 4 standard deviations but you ahve only to use the last 3 (Torso Mass is not sampled).


3) Now, run the TRPO as described in step1 -> TRPO -> READ_ME
