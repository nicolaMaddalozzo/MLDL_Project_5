# MLDL_Project_5
This is the repository for the Machine Learning and Deep Learning exam of polytechnic of Turin, a.a. 2021/2022
READ ME of the repository.

There are 3 folders: Step1, Step2 and Step3.
Every folder is associated with its step in the report. 

Folder Step1 contains 4 folders: REINFORCE, A2C, PPO and TRPO. Every folder has its READ ME for making training and tests of a specific algorithm. 
If the algorithms are runned, follow the READ ME for understanding better how they save the results. 
In this repository, only some results are uploaded for loading limitations. 

For step 2 and step 3, TRPO with GAE 0.8 and lr 0.001 is used. 
In Step 2 and Step 3, only the best model among the UDR configurations is uploaded.
