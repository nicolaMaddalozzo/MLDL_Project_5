# READ ME Actor Critic step 1

With this folder we can run the algorithm Actor Critic. In order to do this the steps are:

1) Training phase. Open a terminal in this folder and compile the "a2c.py" file. There are some hyperparameters that you can specify before to run this file,
   use the command "--help" for more information. 
   command: python3 a2c.py --help
   The env parameter is mandatory

2) After the parameters are choosen, you can run this file. You have to specify each parameter with --name_parameter value_parameter, and after you can run the file. 

3) When it finishes the training, in the folder "results", there will be a folder with the result of the training. Pay attenction to the name of the folder associated 
with the new result because it doesn't change automatically. The name contains information about the hyperparameter choosen. In the folder associated with the training, 
there is the model associated with the total number of episode. This  model is contained in the folder "model".  The folder "logs" contains a csv file with the results 
of the training. 

4) For testing the model associated with a training, you have to run "test.py". You have to put the directory of the model ("name_model_n-episodes.mdl") associated with the
total number of episodes (in the name of the model) as parameter: python3 test.py --model
Use the command --help for more information. For choosing the env on which making a test, you have to change it inside the test.py file.
