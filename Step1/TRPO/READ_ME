 # READ ME TRPO step 1

With this folder we can run the algorithm TRPO. In order to do this the steps are:

1) Training phase. Open a terminal in this folder and compile the "trpo.py" file. There are some hyperparameters that you can specify before to run this file,
   For more information use --help. 
   For choosing a specific env go to line 25.   
    
2) After the hyperparameters are choosen, you can run this file. You have to specify each parameter with --name_parameter value_parameter

3) When it finishes the training, in the folder "results", there will be a folder with the result of the training. Pay attenction to the name of the folder associated 
with the new result because it doesn't change automatically.  The name contains information about the hyperparameter choosen. In the folder associated with the training,
there is one model associated with the final number of steps. This  model is contained in the folder "model".  The folder "logs" contains a csv file with the results of 
the training and the models associated with different number of steps. The folder "graph" contains a graph that represents the training.

4) For testing the model associated with a training, you have to run "eval_ppo.py". You have to put the directory of the model ("name_model_n-episodes.mdl") associated with the
total number of episodes (in the name of the model) inside the file "eval_ppo.py"
For choosing the env on which making a test, you have to change it inside the eval_trpo.py file.
